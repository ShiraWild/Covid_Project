# Covid Project
Answering many questions about Covid through various visualizations and building a model to predict covid concern.
Our main research question - 
Does the size of a certain age group out of the population in a state affect the number of people that got infected or died from Corona virus in that state?


**About the files in the directory:**

1. "05-CovidCases-exploration.html" - Exploration of "covid_cases" dataframe with different visualizations. 
2. "06-CovidConcern-exploration.html" - Exploration of "covid_concern" and "sum_cases" datasets with different visualizations. 
3. "07-trump-exploration.html" - Exploration of "trump tweets" dataframe with different visualization that explore Trump's tweets, with emphasis on covid tweets.
4. "08-prediction.html" - Predictions - filter tweets realted to covid, analyse the sentiments of the tweets per day, find combination of features
for the model, Build linear regression model using k-fold cross validation and tuning for the model parameters to predict the concern level
regarding the covid and comparison between the real value and predicted value, in order to evaluate the model results.
